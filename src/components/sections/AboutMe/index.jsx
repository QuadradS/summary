                    Geographically I am now in Bishkek (Kyrgyzstan). Therefore preferred
                    the way to conduct an interview for me will be - a video call on Skype. However if a face-to-face
                    interview
                    strictly necessary I can plan my trip to Moscow (much in advance).
                    You can write me in advance
                    in <a target={'blank'} href="https://join.skype.com/invite/s96cb3Y4FgAn">skype</a> {' or '}
