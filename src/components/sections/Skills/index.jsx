              Knowledge of the semantics of tags and why to use it, since I wrote ssr for ready-made projects and had
              experience
              work
              with a seo specialist. In addition to semantics, I also worked with seo, in particular:

              <li> - Implementing custom ssr for react</li>

              I constantly typeset and am not afraid of a complex cross-browser adaptive layout; I have layout
              experience as well as with
              modern, convenient flexbox and grid, as well as with the dreaded float table and 'marvelous' layout.
              Always at work
              use
              modern tools for working with css in particular:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li> - Less scss stylus (mixins variables)</li>
              <li> - CSS mobiles and native variables</li>
              <li> - Post css</li>
              <li> - CSS in JS and styled components</li>
              <li> - BEM OOCSS SMACSS</li>

              Extensive JavaScript experience from simple variables and loops to Proxy Promise AsyncAwait and more.
              I wrote quite a lot in native JavaScript, so I know DOM and BOM methods well, I also actively study
              new languages are standard and I try to use them in combat while waiting for the new operator '??',
              classes and so on.
            </p>

            <p>
              I also actively study algorithmic and big O notation, when there is an opportunity I try to bring
              everything algorithmic to execution speed O(nlogn)
